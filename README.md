**Alpine e-commerce Store**

**Introduction**
This project is an Alpine e store that fetches data from **https://fakestoreapi.com/products**. It is created using HTML and CSS and Javascript. I have used the Alpine code in the HTML. It has a navbar with a login, add to cart and wishlist but they do not have functionality.

The images are displayed on cards and they have hover effects, on the cards the image is displayed as well as the title of the product, the price and the category which the item belongs to. There is a category button that sorts out the different item in the categories. 

There is a view details button on the cards that allows user to open a modal that will provide a description of the item.The modal is able to cancel and the viewer can go back to seeing the cards again

**Challenges**
The modal currently opens at the bottom of the screen and not on the screen so yo have to scroll all the way down to see the product they clicked on. I am still working to finish this off.
Another big thing is that i began the project using vanilla css and when i had to do the modal I found modal codes with tailwind css and encorporating the code into my code made the site crash so i have both tailwind and vanilla css. But the code works ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜‚![Uploading MuaKissGIF.gifâ€¦]()

The modal is not styled completely, I struggled to get it to not be transparent and the sizing as well. It does however appearover the item when the view details button is clicked
